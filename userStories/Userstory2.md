**Title**: *User Story On Playwrite*

**As a** Devloper 
**I want** to make sure that all playwrites tests pass succfully before merging and ull requests 
**So that** the code will run without any issues and there is intregity in the codebase. 

**Context**: Our project is a web applkication that needs to work with other browsers. Playwrite is a node.js library that can automate testing in diffrent browsers. It will be used to script user interactions and how correct our app is.
